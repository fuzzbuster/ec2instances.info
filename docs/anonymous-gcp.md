# Google Compute Engine credential requirements

Google Compute Engine is the exception among the supported providers: the
current scraper cannot collect its dataset anonymously.

## Why credentials are required

The scraper uses the Cloud Billing Catalog API for SKUs and prices and the
Compute Engine API for machine types and regions:

- `https://cloudbilling.googleapis.com`
- `https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1`

Anonymous requests to the required endpoints return authorization failures
(observed as HTTP 403). Public product pages do not expose an equivalent,
structured regional specification and pricing dataset.

## Required configuration

- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
- `GCP_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- `GCP_PRIVATE_KEY`

The service account requests `compute.readonly` and `cloud-billing.readonly`
OAuth scopes. See [GCP setup](setting-up-gcp.md).

## Failure behavior

The CLI validates the required variables before starting a GCP scrape. Missing
credentials are a configuration error; there is no anonymous or static
fallback.
