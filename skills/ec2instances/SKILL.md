# ec2instances

Use the `ec2instances` CLI to collect cloud virtual-machine specifications,
availability, and pricing. This skill covers compute instances only. Do not use
it for RDS, managed databases, caches, data warehouses, or search services.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the binary is available:

   ```sh
   ec2instances --json version
   ```

2. Inspect supported providers and credential requirements:

   ```sh
   ec2instances --json providers
   ```

3. Select only the providers required for the task. Never start an implicit
   full-provider scrape.

4. Run the scrape with an explicit output directory:

   ```sh
   ec2instances --json scrape \
     --providers tencentcloud,volcengine \
     --request-timeout 2m \
     --request-attempts 3 \
     --output-dir ./output
   ```

5. Parse the single JSON object from stdout. Treat stderr as diagnostic logs.

6. Accept the snapshot only when the exit code is `0`, `status` is `ok`, and
   `partial` is `false`.

## Configuration

Provider precedence:

1. `--providers`
2. `EC2INSTANCES_PROVIDERS`
3. `ALLOWED_SERVICES`

Output directory precedence:

1. `--output-dir`
2. `EC2INSTANCES_OUTPUT_DIR`
3. `./output`

HTTP request setting precedence:

1. `--request-timeout` / `--request-attempts`
2. `EC2INSTANCES_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` / `EC2INSTANCES_REQUEST_ATTEMPTS`
3. `15m` per request attempt / 6 maximum attempts

The timeout applies to each HTTP attempt, not to a complete provider scrape.
Use Go duration syntax such as `30s` or `2m`. Standard `HTTP_PROXY`,
`HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables control proxies.

Required credentials:

- `gcp`: `GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `GCP_PRIVATE_KEY`

Optional credentials:

- `aws`: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; optional
  `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`. The credentials need `ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes`.
- `azure`: `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`,
  `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `alicloud`: `ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY`, `ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY`
- `tencentcloud`: `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID`, `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY`
- `volcengine`: `VOLCENGINE_ACCESS_KEY`, `VOLCENGINE_SECRET_KEY`
- `huaweicloud`: `HUAWEICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY`, `HUAWEICLOUD_SECRET_KEY`,
  `HUAWEICLOUD_PROJECT_ID`, `HUAWEICLOUD_REGION`

These optional credentials enrich data collected from public or anonymous
sources. Vultr, Linode, DigitalOcean, and Hetzner need no credentials.

AWS output includes Linux On-Demand pricing. It excludes Reserved and Spot
pricing, interruption rates, and Spot savings estimates.
Azure credentials add Compute SKU capability fields; base specifications and
regional pricing do not require credentials.

Never print credentials or place them in command arguments. Pass them through
the process environment.

## Results

Every dataset has three files:

```text
instances.json
instances.json.gz
instances.json.br
```

The exact relative directory depends on the provider. Use the absolute
`output_dir` returned by the command as the root.

Scrape result fields:

- `status`: `ok` for complete success, `error` for failures
- `command`: command name, currently `scrape`
- `output_dir`: absolute root directory for generated files
- `succeeded`: providers that completed
- `failed`: provider name and error message
- `partial`: true when execution produced an incomplete snapshot
- `error`: top-level failure summary

Exit codes:

- `0`: complete success
- `1`: runtime/provider failure; files may be partial
- `2`: invalid arguments, provider selection, or credentials

Do not silently consume files from a failed or partial run. Report the failed
providers and let the caller decide whether successful provider files are
usable.

## Installation

Use a matching archive from:

```text
https://github.com/fuzzbuster/ec2instances.info/releases
```

Verify the archive against `checksums.txt`. Supported release targets are Linux
and macOS on amd64 and arm64.
